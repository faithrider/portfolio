# Portfolio Svelte

This is the code for my personal portfolio website built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

## Sections of the site

I have three major components of my [website](https://www.faithmrider.com/), related to the reasons you may be looking:

- *Honors Portfolio*, which includes the [Year in Review](https://www.faithmrider.com/year-in-review), [Honors Experiences](https://www.faithmrider.com/honors-experiences), and [Travel Blog](https://www.faithmrider.com/travel-blog) sections. These pieces are anything related to my experience in UC's Honors program.
- *General Portfolio*, currently consisting of the [Projects](https://www.faithmrider.com/projects) section. These include both my CS specific projects, and also any other noteworthy projects I've worked on/been a part of.
- *Other*, currently consisting of my [Photography](https://www.faithmrider.com/photography) section. Generally speaking, this component is a catch-all for anything not related to academics or professional interests. So anything that is a personal hobby or passion of mine that I wish to share!
